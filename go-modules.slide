* Introduce Go Modules

Modules provide an integrated solution for three key problems that have been a pain point for developers since Goâ€™s initial release:

- Ability to work with Go code outside of the GOPATH workspace.

- Ability to version a dependency and identify the most compatible version to use.

- Ability to manage dependencies natively using the Go tooling.
